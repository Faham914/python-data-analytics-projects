## Zomato Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

### Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and preparing a real-world Zomato restaurant dataset for analysis. The primary goal was to handle missing values, validate data integrity, and ensure the dataset is suitable for downstream analytics and machine learning tasks.

---

### Objectives
- Identify and analyze missing values
- Apply appropriate data cleaning strategies
- Preserve dataset structure during cleaning
- Validate data quality before and after preprocessing

---

### Tools Used
- Python
- pandas
- NumPy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

---

### Key Steps Performed
- Missing value detection and visualization
- Column-wise cleaning and validation
- Before-and-after comparison using heatmaps
- Dataset consistency checks

---

### Dataset
- Zomato restaurant dataset (educational / public source)
- Raw data files are not included to keep the repository lightweight

---

### Outcome
The dataset was successfully cleaned while maintaining its original structure, making it ready for exploratory data analysis and machine learning workflows.
