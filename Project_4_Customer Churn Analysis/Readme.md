## Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning

### Project Overview
This project builds machine learning models to predict customer churn in a telecom context. The goal is to identify customers likely to churn using historical data and compare the performance of different classification models.

---

### Objectives
- Analyze customer behavior and churn patterns
- Build and evaluate multiple machine learning models
- Compare model performance using evaluation metrics

---

### Tools Used
- Python
- pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

---

### Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

---

### Key Steps Performed
- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- Train-test split
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance comparison across models

---

### Dataset
- Telecom customer churn dataset (educational use)
- Raw dataset files are not included

---

### Outcome
The project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow, from data preparation to model evaluation, highlighting core predictive analytics skills.
